# Project Overview

### Adaptive Workload Parameter Suggestion System

The **Adaptive Workload Parameter Suggestion System** is designed to predict the optimal parameter combinations for stress tests based on pre-requisite data collected from various workloads, configurations, and system setups. The system learns from historical, non-granular data to explore new configurations that havenâ€™t been explicitly tested. This allows it to suggest parameter combinations that yield the highest performance, even for input values outside the training data.

Unlike traditional parameter tuning, which relies on manual efforts or basic optimization techniques, this system uses machine learning to predict the best-performing parameters across a **continuous space of input values**. It is adaptive to different architectures and system configurations but is not real-time, reducing the number of input runs required.

## Motivation

In complex systems, such as cloud infrastructures or high-performance computing environments, stress tests are vital for qualifying systems and quantify their performance. These tests rely on various input parameters such as workload-specific parameters, memory available, or VM SKU, and finding the optimal combination manually can be time-consuming and inefficient.

Our motivation comes from the need to automate this process and **explore the parameter space** in a way that uncovers new, optimal configurations. This approach allows us to optimize performance without requiring granular input data or exhaustive testing of every possible configuration.

## Impact

- **Optimized Performance**: The system predicts the parameter combinations that ensure workloads run under the most favourable conditions.
- **Adaptability**: The system is flexible and can work with different hardware configurations, operating systems, and dependency versions.
- **Exploration of New Configurations**: The machine learning model suggests parameter combinations that may not have been tested before, expanding the space of possible configurations and improving overall performance.
- **Reduced Manual Tuning**: By automating parameter optimization, the system reduces the time and effort spent on manual tuning and trial-and-error methods.

## Applications

1. **Cloud Infrastructure Optimization**: Predicts the best parameter configurations for different VM SKUs to optimize resource allocation and performance.
2. **Software Development & Testing**: Automatically suggests stress test configurations for applications, speeding up the testing process.
3. **Data Center Efficiency**: Provides recommendations for optimal configurations to enhance the performance of data center operations during stress tests.

## Technical Details

The system works by training a machine learning model on pre-collected data. Each data point contains:

- **Input Parameters (P)**: Numeric values representing workload conditions (e.g., workload size, I/O intensity, memory usage).
- **Configuration Parameters (C)**: Encoded values for VM SKUs, OS versions, or other hardware configurations.
- **Performance Metrics (S)**: Metrics such as throughput, execution time, or memory usage that indicate performance levels, which are outputs of the workload.
- **Success**: A binary indicator of whether the test succeeded or failed.

The system implements multiple strategies to predict the optimal combination of input parameters:

### 1. Supervised Regression Model with Optimization Algorithms
We use a **supervised regression model** (such as a neural network) to learn the relationship between the input parameters (P, C) and the performance metrics (S). The model approximates the function

`S = f(P, C)`. 

Once trained, the model can predict the performance for new parameter combinations that were not part of the training data.

To identify the optimal parameter combinations, we apply **optimization algorithms** like **gradient-based methods** or **Bayesian optimization** to explore the continuous space of input parameters and maximize performance. These methods efficiently explore possible combinations of P and C, returning the combination that provides the best predicted performance.

### 2. Genetic Algorithm-Based Optimization
Another approach we employ is using **genetic algorithms** to find the optimal parameter combinations. In this method:

1. We initialize a population of random parameter sets (P, C).
2. Each set of parameters is evaluated by the model to predict its corresponding performance metric (S).
3. The algorithm selects the best-performing parameter sets (based on S) and combines them (through crossover and mutation) to create a new generation of parameter sets.
4. This process repeats, with each generation converging toward the optimal parameter combinations that maximize performance.

The genetic algorithm approach is particularly useful when the parameter space is large and complex, as it can efficiently search through a wide range of possible configurations by mimicking natural selection and evolution.

### Summary of Techniques

- **Supervised Regression**: Learns the relationship between input parameters and performance metrics and predicts untested configurations.
- **Genetic Algorithm**: Mimics natural selection to evolve parameter combinations over several generations.

These different approaches ensure that the system can handle a variety of input data and configurations while efficiently predicting the optimal parameter combinations to improve performance and minimize failures.

## Conclusion

The **Adaptive Workload Parameter Suggestion System** leverages machine learning to optimize stress tests by exploring untested parameter combinations. It reduces the manual effort required for tuning and ensures that workloads run with maximum efficiency across a variety of architectures and configurations.
